# LHHS-Hackathon-2019-Next.JS-Lecture
At the LHHS Hackathon 2019, I attended a Next.JS lecture. Here is a program I wrote with what I learned about Next.JS. The ZIP file contains all the code that was included with the environment provided at the lecture, as well as the code I wrote. The code I wrote is also provided in the /pages/ folder.
